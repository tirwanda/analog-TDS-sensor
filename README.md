TDS probes cannot be used in water above 55 °C.
The TDS probe should not be placed too close to the edge of the container, as it will affect the display.
The head and lead of the TDS probe are waterproof and can be immersed in water, but the connection interface and the signal adapter board are not waterproof. Please pay attention to use.
